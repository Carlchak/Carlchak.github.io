        The Student Union is the representative of the students and is elected by the whole school. We believe that the Student Union should shoulder the responsibility of making students’ school career more remarkable.<br>

        【In School】

      <div class="text">
        In school, our cabinet will organize various activities to relieve the heavy pressure of schoolmates on weekdays. We hope that students can<br>
        cultivate their sense of citizenship, social skills and team spirit by those activities.<br>
        The so-called " Gems unwrought does nothing useful ", we hope that the activities we organized can help training students to improve their<br>
        talents with versatility, benevolence and justice, and be a person who is worthful to the society.<br>
        The Student Union acts as a bridge of communication between students and the school. We will actively collect the opinions from students and<br>
        reflect them to the school. Simultaneously, we will also convey the decisions and<br>
        considerations of the school to the students, hoping to avoid misunderstandings between the two sides and encourage harmony.<br>
        In order to facilitate the daily life needs of students, we will provide different types of services, such as selling tissues, cheap but helpful<br>
        stationery, white socks, etc., and lending sewing boxes, hairdryers, etc. for students in need.<br>
        Not for profit, Just for the convenience of classmates.<br>
        We hope that the wonderful activities, comprehensive welfare, and enlightened atmosphere we provide can enhance students' sense of<br>
        belonging to the school and create a harmonious and beautiful campus.<br>
